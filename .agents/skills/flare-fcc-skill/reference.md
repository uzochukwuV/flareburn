# Flare Confidential Compute (FCC) / TEE Extensions — Reference

Use these links for official docs, source repositories, contract surfaces, and the platform the TEEs run on.

## Flare Developer Hub (FCC)

- [FCC Overview](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/overview) — Architecture, key features, Flare Compute Extensions, Protocol Managed Wallets, TEE-based FDC. FCC is in the final stages of development (not yet a fully public production system), but you can already build Flare Compute Extensions.
- [Build Your First Extension (Getting Started)](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/guides/getting-started) — Hello World scaffold walkthrough: instruction lifecycle, the files you own, OPType/OPCommand customization, and deploying/testing on Coston2. Start here.
- [Private Key Extension Guide](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/guides/sign-extension) — Step-by-step walkthrough: contract code, offchain handler (Go/Python/TypeScript), Coston2 deployment with ngrok, end-to-end test, troubleshooting, and cleanup
- [Weather Insurance Extension Guide](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/guides/weather-insurance-extension) — Full FCC application: parametric rainfall insurance, ECIES-encrypted private policies, settlement via OpenWeatherMap data, Next.js frontend. Prerequisites: Docker Desktop, Foundry, Go, an HTTPS tunnel (ngrok or cloudflared) to port 6674, an OpenWeatherMap API key, and a funded Coston2 wallet.
- [FCC Whitepaper](https://dev.flare.network/pdf/whitepapers/20260706-FlareConfidentialCompute.pdf) — "Flare Confidential Compute: Powering Interoperability for Flare through TEEs" (Jul 6, 2026): the FCC mechanism, Protocol Managed Wallets, Flare Compute Extensions, and FDC2

## Signing Example

- [flare-foundation/fce-sign](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-sign) — Example TEE extension that stores a private key and signs messages with it. Ships in Go, Python, and TypeScript (select with `LANGUAGE`). **Demo only**: it stores an encrypted secret on-chain, which is not safe for production.
- [fce-sign REPRODUCIBILITY.md](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-sign/blob/main/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) — `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, reproducible image builds, and the cross-machine code-hash caveats for Python/TS

## Weather Insurance Extension

- [flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance) — Full FCC application: parametric rainfall insurance using OpenWeatherMap data inside a TEE. Includes Go handler, `WeatherInsurance.sol`, ECIES-encrypted private policies, and a Next.js frontend.
- [flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance-x402-agent](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance-x402-agent) — AI agent showcase: buys and settles weather insurance policies against the extension above using [x402 payments](https://dev.flare.network/fxrp/token-interactions/x402-payments).

## Contract Interfaces

These ship as minimal local interfaces in the scaffold and are slated to move into `flare-smart-contracts-v2` once published as a package:

- [`ITeeExtensionRegistry.sol`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-extension-scaffold/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/ITeeExtensionRegistry.sol) — `sendInstructions(address[] teeIds, TeeInstructionParams params)`, `nextPublicExtensionId()` (public extension IDs start at `0x10000`), `getTeeExtensionInstructionsSender(uint256)`
- [`ITeeMachineRegistry.sol`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-extension-scaffold/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/ITeeMachineRegistry.sol) — `getRandomTeeIds(uint256 extensionId, uint256 count)`
- [`InstructionSender.sol`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-extension-scaffold/blob/main/contracts/InstructionSender.sol) — Reference on-chain entry point (`HelloWorldInstructionSender`)

## Networks (deploy targets)

- **Coston2** (Flare testnet): RPC `https://coston2-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc`, chain ID `114`, faucet `https://faucet.flare.network/coston2`
- **Coston** (Songbird testnet): RPC `https://coston-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc`, faucet `https://faucet.flare.network/coston`
- See the [flare-general skill](../flare-general-skill/SKILL.md) and [Flare Developer Hub](https://dev.flare.network/) for the full network table.

## Key Operational Values

- **Attestation mode:** `MODE=0` = production attestation (FTDC-accepted); `MODE=1` = simulated (rejected on testnet/mainnet).
- **Local vs live:** `LOCAL_MODE=true` skips attestation for local dev; set `false` on Coston/Coston2. Pair with `SIMULATED_TEE=false`.
- **Reproducible builds:** set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (e.g. `git log -1 --format=%ct`) so the same source yields the same code hash. Go is bit-for-bit cross-machine; Python/TS are best-effort.
- **`register-tee -command rRap`** — issues a fresh attestation challenge on re-runs (avoids `Verification.ChallengeExpired`).
- **Proxy `/info` → `machineData`:** `platform` starts `0x4743505f414d445f534556…` (GCP_AMD_SEV); `codeHash` must be a real measured hash (not the simulated `0x194844cf…`); `extensionId`/`initialOwner` must match `config/extension.env`.
