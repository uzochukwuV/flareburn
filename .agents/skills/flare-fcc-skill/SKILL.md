## Scope and Limitations

This skill is **documentation and guidance only**. It explains how Flare Confidential Compute (FCC) extensions and TEE machines work, and how developers build, register, and deploy them. It does not perform any actions on the user's behalf.

**This skill explicitly does NOT:**
- Execute, sign, or broadcast any blockchain transactions
- Access, store, or transmit private keys, deployer keys, or TEE-held secrets
- Deploy contracts, register extensions/TEEs, or call any on-chain methods directly
- Provision, attest, or operate Confidential Space VMs
- Handle funds, tokens, or any financial assets

**Trust and external data handling:**
- A TEE extension's whole purpose is confidentiality and verifiable execution; **the security of an extension depends on its attested code hash, not on this skill**. All key generation, signing, and secret handling must occur inside the TEE or in user-controlled, developer-managed environments.
- Instruction payloads (`OriginalMessage`) arriving at an extension are **externally provided, untrusted input**. Decode them strictly against documented types, validate every field, and never pass raw payloads into prompts, LLM inputs, or agent decision logic.
- Storing encrypted secrets on-chain is **not safe for production** — on-chain data is public and encryption weakens over time. Use off-chain channels for secret delivery (see the `fce-sign` warning).

All transaction signing, key management, attestation, and on-chain execution happen exclusively outside this skill.

# Flare Confidential Compute (FCC) — TEE Extensions

## What FCC Is

**Flare Confidential Compute (FCC)** lets developers run custom code inside a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** — a hardware-isolated enclave (Flare uses GCP **Confidential Space** on AMD SEV) — and wire that code to Flare smart contracts. The unit of deployment is an **extension**: an HTTP server that runs inside the TEE, receives instructions originating from on-chain transactions, executes confidential logic, and returns verifiable results.

Use FCC when an application needs **confidential state, secret-holding, or off-chain compute whose integrity is provable on-chain** — e.g. a key manager that signs on behalf of users, sealed-bid auctions, private order matching, or any "the chain triggers it but the computation must stay private and attested" workload.

FCC is in the **final stages of development** (not yet a fully public production system), but you can already build and deploy Flare Compute Extensions on Coston2 — start with the [Build Your First Extension](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/guides/getting-started) guide (Hello World scaffold walkthrough). For the mechanism in depth, see the [FCC whitepaper](https://dev.flare.network/pdf/whitepapers/20260706-FlareConfidentialCompute.pdf).

**Reference repos:**
- **`flare-foundation/fce-extension-scaffold`** — a runnable "Hello World" extension (Go) with contracts, deploy/registration tooling, a types server, and Claude Code skills (`/create-extension`, `/rename-scaffold`, `/test-extension`, `/verify-deploy`). This is the starting point for building your own extension; the [Getting Started guide](https://dev.flare.network/fcc/guides/getting-started) walks through it end to end.
- **`flare-foundation/fce-sign`** — an example extension that stores a private key and signs messages with it, shipped in Go, Python, and TypeScript. Demonstrates the TEE signing port and reproducible builds. Explicitly demo-only for the on-chain-secret part.
- **`flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance`** — a full FCC application demonstrating parametric rainfall insurance. Policyholders buy cover on-chain; the TEE fetches OpenWeatherMap data and signs settlement results; anyone calls `settle()` to verify and pay out. Supports public and ECIES-encrypted private policies. Includes a Next.js dApp frontend.

## The Instruction Lifecycle

An extension controls only two things: the **on-chain contract** (step 1) and the **action handler** (step 6). The TEE infrastructure handles everything between.

```
1. User calls your InstructionSender contract (on-chain)
2. Contract routes through TeeExtensionRegistry.sendInstructions() → emits TeeInstructionsSent
3. TEE proxy picks up the instruction from the chain
4. TEE node fetches the instruction from the proxy
5. TEE node forwards it as POST /action to your extension server (inside the TEE)
6. Your extension decodes, validates, executes, and returns a result
7. TEE node returns the (optionally cosigned) result to the proxy
8. Caller polls the proxy for the result
```

## On-Chain Building Blocks

Two protocol contracts (from `flare-smart-contracts-v2`) front the system:

- **`TeeExtensionRegistry`** — the registry of extensions and the only path to submit instructions. Key surface:
  - `sendInstructions(address[] _teeIds, TeeInstructionParams _params) payable returns (bytes32 instructionId)` — the single entry point. `TeeInstructionParams` = `{ bytes32 opType; bytes32 opCommand; bytes message; address[] cosigners; uint64 cosignersThreshold; address claimBackAddress; }`.
  - `nextPublicExtensionId()` and `getTeeExtensionInstructionsSender(uint256 extensionId)` — used to discover an extension's ID. Public extension IDs start at `0x10000` (65536); IDs below that are reserved for system extensions, so `setExtensionId()` scans from `0x10000` up to `nextPublicExtensionId()`, not from zero.
  - **Access control:** when you register an extension you bind it to one **InstructionSender address**. The registry rejects any `sendInstructions` call whose `msg.sender` isn't that address — no EOA, no other contract.
- **`TeeMachineRegistry`** — maps extensions to the TEE machines serving them. `getRandomTeeIds(uint256 _extensionId, uint256 _count)` picks machine addresses to route an instruction to (use `_count > 1` to fan one instruction out to multiple TEEs).

### The InstructionSender contract

This is **your** contract and the only address allowed to submit instructions for your extension. Minimum requirements:

1. **Know its extension ID** — to look up serving TEE machines. The scaffold's `setExtensionId()` scans the registry (starting at `0x10000`, the first public extension ID) after registration and caches the ID (set-once).
2. **Call `sendInstructions` on `TeeExtensionRegistry`** with at least one `teeId`, the `opType`/`opCommand` `bytes32` identifiers, a non-empty `message`, and (usually empty) cosigners.
3. **Be `payable` and forward `msg.value`** — the registry charges a per-instruction fee.
4. **Exist before registration** — you register by passing the deployed InstructionSender address.

The scaffold's `HelloWorldInstructionSender` is a ready template: it defines `bytes32` operation constants and one `payable` send function per action (`sendSayHello`, `sendSayGoodbye`). You can also write a minimal custom sender for custom access control, on-chain validation, multi-TEE routing, cosigner workflows, or batching — the registry only cares that the registered address calls `sendInstructions` with valid params.

## The OPType / OPCommand Routing Model

The contract and the extension code are linked by a two-level identifier that **must match exactly across three layers**:

| Layer | Operation type | Command |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Solidity | `bytes32 OP_TYPE_GREETING = bytes32("GREETING")` | `bytes32 OP_COMMAND_SAY_HELLO = bytes32("SAY_HELLO")` |
| Go config | `OPTypeGreeting = "GREETING"` | `OPCommandSayHello = "SAY_HELLO"` |
| Go router | `dataFixed.OPType == teeutils.ToHash(config.OPTypeGreeting)` | `df.OPCommand == teeutils.ToHash(config.OPCommandSayHello)` |

`OPType` selects an operation group; `OPCommand` sub-routes within it. A mismatched `OPType` falls through to "unsupported op type"; a mismatched `OPCommand` to "unsupported op command". `bytes32("...")` only holds up to 31 bytes — keep identifiers short.

## The Extension (Go) — Action Handler

Inside the TEE, the extension is an HTTP server. The TEE node delivers each instruction as `POST /action`. You implement `processAction`, which parses `instruction.DataFixed` (carrying `OPType`, `OPCommand`, and the raw `OriginalMessage`) out of the action and routes on `OPType`, then on `OPCommand`.

Each handler follows the same **4-step pattern**:

```go
func (e *Extension) processSayHello(action teetypes.Action, df *instruction.DataFixed) teetypes.ActionResult {
    // 1. DECODE the raw OriginalMessage (JSON here; use structs.DecodeTo for ABI-encoded)
    var req types.SayHelloRequest
    dec := json.NewDecoder(bytes.NewReader(df.OriginalMessage))
    dec.DisallowUnknownFields()
    if err := dec.Decode(&req); err != nil {
        return buildResult(action, df, nil, 0, fmt.Errorf("decoding request: %w", err))
    }

    // 2. VALIDATE every field — this is untrusted external input
    if req.Name == "" {
        return buildResult(action, df, nil, 0, fmt.Errorf("name must not be empty"))
    }

    // 3. EXECUTE your confidential logic (guard shared state with the mutex)
    e.mu.Lock()
    e.greetingCount++
    n := e.greetingCount
    e.mu.Unlock()

    // 4. BUILD the result: status 1 = success (data returned), status 0 = error (err logged)
    data, _ := json.Marshal(types.SayHelloResponse{Greeting: "Hello, " + req.Name, GreetingNumber: n})
    return buildResult(action, df, data, 1, nil)
}
```

**Files a developer modifies** (the scaffold marks them ★, and `/rename-scaffold` automates renaming the Hello World placeholders):

1. `internal/config/config.go` — `OPType`/`OPCommand` string constants and version
2. `pkg/types/types.go` — request/response/state structs
3. `internal/extension/extension.go` — routing cases + handlers (the main customization point)
4. `pkg/types/register.go` — decoder registrations for the types server
5. `contracts/InstructionSender.sol` — matching `bytes32` constants + send functions
6. `tools/cmd/run-test/main.go` — E2E test payloads and assertions

After editing the contract, run `./scripts/generate-bindings.sh` to regenerate Go bindings.

### TEE signing port

Extensions that need to sign, attest, or encrypt with TEE-managed keys call the TEE's **sign port** (e.g. `localhost:7701`/`SIGN_PORT`, or `9090` in some docs — read the scaffold's config) from inside the extension. This is how `fce-sign` signs messages without the key ever leaving the enclave.

### Types server

A lightweight HTTP sidecar (`POST /decode`, `GET /registry`, `GET /health`, default port `8100`) that turns raw hex instruction data into human-readable JSON for frontends and debugging. You register a decoder per `(OPType, OPCommand, Kind)` in `pkg/types/register.go` using `NewJSONDecoder` or `NewABIDecoder` (the ABI decoder takes the ABI argument); `Kind` is `message` (request) or `result` (response). `Lookup` matches `(OPType, OPCommand, Kind)` exactly, then falls back to `(OPType, "", Kind)`.

## fce-sign: Private Key Extension Example

The `fce-sign` repo demonstrates the full TEE workflow: store an ECIES-encrypted private key, sign arbitrary messages. Available in Go, Python, and TypeScript (set `LANGUAGE` in `.env`).

### Docker Service Architecture

Three containers run as Docker services:

- **`extension-tee`** — your extension code. Receives decoded instructions from the proxy and returns results.
- **`ext-proxy`** — watches the chain for new instructions, forwards them to your handler, submits results back on-chain.
- **`redis`** — in-memory store used by the proxy.

### Port Reference (fce-sign)

| Service            | Container port | Host port |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| ext-proxy internal | 6663           | 6673      |
| ext-proxy external | 6664           | 6674      |
| redis              | 6379           | 6382      |

ngrok exposes host port **6674** (ext-proxy external) to the internet. The internal port 6673 is used for communication between the extension container and the proxy within Docker.

### Deploying fce-sign on Coston2 (Local Simulated TEE)

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop, Foundry, Go, ngrok, a funded Coston2 wallet.

**Step 0 — Activate local simulated mode:**
```bash
./scripts/use-chain.sh local coston2 go   # or python / typescript
```
Sets `SIMULATED_TEE=true` and `LOCAL_MODE=false` (real Coston2 chain, simulated attestation). Run `./scripts/use-chain.sh --list` to see all options.

**Step 1 — Configure deployer keys** in `.env.local.coston2`:
```bash
DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY="<funded-coston2-private-key-hex-no-0x>"
INITIAL_OWNER="0x<your-address>"
```
Re-run `use-chain.sh` after editing so `.env` picks up changes.

**Step 2 — Reserve a public proxy URL** (separate terminal): `post-build.sh`, `start-services.sh`, and `test.sh` all read `EXT_PROXY_URL` from `.env`, so set it **before** deploying the contract or starting Docker services.

> **Security:** `ngrok http 6674` makes your local **ext-proxy** public — port 6674 exposes the proxy HTTP API and anyone with the URL can call it. Use ngrok only for Coston2 testnet, and stop the tunnel when finished.

```bash
ngrok http 6674
```
Copy the HTTPS URL from ngrok's **Forwarding** line and set `EXT_PROXY_URL` in `.env.local.coston2`, then re-run `use-chain.sh`. The proxy isn't running yet — ngrok forwards traffic once Step 5 starts `ext-proxy`. The `ngrok` free tier keeps this URL stable across restarts, so this is normally a one-time step.

**Step 3 — Deploy contract and register extension:**
```bash
./scripts/pre-build.sh
```
Compiles Solidity, deploys `InstructionSender`, registers the extension on-chain. Writes `EXTENSION_ID` and `INSTRUCTION_SENDER` to `config/extension.env`.

> **Warning:** once `config/extension.env` exists, pre-build refuses to run again. Use `--force` only when intentionally creating a new extension — it deploys a new `InstructionSender` and registers a new extension ID, which will cause `MachineManager.TooMany()` if an older TEE machine is still registered under the previous extension ID.

**Step 4 — Configure the indexer DB:**
```bash
cp config/proxy/extension_proxy.coston2.docker.toml.example \
   config/proxy/extension_proxy.coston2.docker.toml
```
Edit the `[db]` block with the Coston2 indexer credentials (host `34.38.42.208`, port `3306`, database `indexer`). Credentials are provided on request via [support](https://flare.network/resources/technical-support) or [@flare_network](https://x.com/flare_network).

**Step 5 — Start the extension stack:**
```bash
./scripts/start-services.sh
```
Builds the extension image, then starts redis, ext-proxy, and extension-tee. The script itself waits for `EXT_PROXY_URL/info` — with ngrok already running from Step 2, that check goes through your public tunnel to the local proxy. Wait for the proxy locally: `until curl -sf http://localhost:6674/info >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done`. Confirm only the extension proxy is listening on 6674: `lsof -i :6674`.

**Step 6 — Verify the proxy:**
```bash
curl -s "$EXT_PROXY_URL/info" | jq '.machineData'
```
Simulated TEE: `codeHash` = `0x194844cf…`, `extensionId` matches `config/extension.env`, `initialOwner` matches your address.

**Step 7 — Register the TEE machine:**
```bash
./scripts/post-build.sh
```
Runs three onchain steps: `allow-tee-version` (whitelists code hash), `set-governance` (registers the extension's TEE governance signer set/threshold — defaults to the deployer as sole signer with threshold 1 unless you set `GOVERNANCE_SIGNERS`/`GOVERNANCE_THRESHOLD` in `.env`), and `register-tee -command rRap` (registers the machine, issues fresh attestation, runs FTDC check, promotes to production). The governance set must match what the `extension-tee` node container was given, or registration reverts with `InvalidGovernanceHash`.

**Step 8 — Run end-to-end test:**
```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```
Sequence: `setExtensionId()` → fetch TEE public key → ECIES-encrypt a test private key → `updateKey` on-chain → wait for processing → `sign` on-chain → verify ECDSA signature matches.

### Python and TypeScript Handler Framework

Python and TypeScript use a `Framework` class that registers handlers by `(opType, opCommand)` pair:

```python
def register(framework: Framework) -> None:
    framework.handle(OP_TYPE_KEY, OP_COMMAND_UPDATE, handle_key_update)
    framework.handle(OP_TYPE_KEY, OP_COMMAND_SIGN, handle_key_sign)
```

Each handler receives a hex-encoded `originalMessage` and returns `(data, status, error)`:
- **`data`:** hex-encoded return data written back on-chain, or `None`
- **`status`:** `0` = error, `1` = success, `>=2` = pending
- **`error`:** error message string if the handler failed

The `base/` package (Python/TypeScript) provides `hex_to_bytes`/`bytes_to_hex` and the `Framework` HTTP server. **Do not modify `base/`** — it is framework infrastructure.

### Building Your Own Extension from fce-sign

1. Clone the repo and pick a language.
2. Define `opType`/`opCommand` constants in both the Solidity contract and your handler.
3. Modify `contracts/InstructionSender.sol` with your constants and parameters.
4. Write handlers in `go/internal/extension/` (Go) or `app/` (Python/TypeScript).
5. Follow the deployment steps above — `go/tools/` deploy CLIs are shared regardless of language.

### Cleanup

**Stop the stack:**
```bash
./scripts/stop-services.sh
```

**Full reset** (start from scratch):
```bash
./scripts/stop-services.sh
docker compose down --rmi local
rm -f .env config/extension.env config/proxy/extension_proxy.coston2.docker.toml
```

Then restart from Step 0. Note: on-chain state (deployed contracts, registered extensions, TEEs) cannot be reset — each `pre-build.sh` deploys new contracts.

### fce-sign Troubleshooting

- **Proxy won't start / DB sync error** — check `docker compose logs ext-proxy`; verify DB credentials in `config/proxy/extension_proxy.coston2.docker.toml`.
- **Transaction reverts** — insufficient C2FLR; use the [Coston2 faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).
- **`MachineManager.TooMany()`** — `config/extension.env` extension ID doesn't match the on-chain TEE record (usually after `pre-build.sh --force`). Do a full reset or keep the existing `extension.env` and re-run only `post-build.sh` + `test.sh`.
- **`Verification.ChallengeExpired`** — re-run `post-build.sh`.
- **`InvalidGovernanceHash`** — the `GOVERNANCE_SIGNERS`/`GOVERNANCE_THRESHOLD` used by `set-governance` don't match the governance hash signed by the TEE node; leave both unset for the default deployer-only setup, or ensure `.env` and the node container agree, then re-run `post-build.sh`.
- **`code hashes do not match`** — `SIMULATED_TEE` and container `MODE` disagree; use `SIMULATED_TEE=true` with `MODE=1` (injected by Docker Compose).
- **TEE registration times out** — try `docker compose restart ext-proxy`; FDC attestation requires active relay providers on Coston2.
- **ngrok URL changed** — update `EXT_PROXY_URL` in `.env.local.coston2`, re-run `use-chain.sh`, restart the ngrok tunnel if needed (`ngrok http 6674`), restart Docker stack, re-run `post-build.sh` and `test.sh`.

## fce-weather-insurance: Parametric Insurance Example

The `fce-weather-insurance` repo is a full FCC application: **parametric rainfall insurance** settled from OpenWeatherMap data inside the enclave. It shows the pattern for TEE workloads that fetch off-chain data, sign a result, and have an on-chain contract verify that signature before moving funds — the same shape as any oracle-backed settlement. See [flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance-x402-agent](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fce-weather-insurance-x402-agent) for an AI agent that buys and settles policies against this extension using [x402 payments](https://dev.flare.network/fxrp/token-interactions/x402-payments).

### Flow

1. A policyholder buys rainfall cover for a date + location, paying an ERC-20 premium (`payToken`); the contract reserves the payout from pool liquidity.
2. From `settlementUnlockAt` (00:00 UTC the day after the coverage date), a keeper calls `requestSettlement`, which routes a `WEATHER`/`SETTLE` instruction to the extension.
3. The extension fetches that day's precipitation from OpenWeatherMap **inside the enclave** and signs the settlement result.
4. Anyone calls `settle()` with the signed `ActionResult`; the contract wraps the result hash in a domain-separated payload, `ecrecover`s the signer, requires it equals the registered `teeAddress`, and pays out if the rainfall threshold was met.

### OP identifiers (`OP_TYPE_WEATHER = bytes32("WEATHER")`)

| Command  | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `FETCH`  | Return current weather JSON for a city (testing / dApp display). |
| `SETTLE` | Fetch daily rainfall for a policy and return a signed settlement payload. |
| `BUY`    | Decrypt an ECIES-encrypted private policy and return attested terms. |

As always, the constants must match exactly across `WeatherInsurance.sol` and `internal/config/config.go`.

### Public vs private policies

- **Public buy** (`buyPolicy`): all terms are on-chain; caller `approve`s the premium first.
- **Private buy** (`buyPolicyPrivate`): the buyer ECIES-encrypts ABI-encoded `PrivateBuyParams` with the extension public key; the ciphertext is sent as a `WEATHER`/`BUY` instruction. The TEE decrypts via the node's `/decrypt` endpoint, holds the threshold in enclave memory keyed by `termsCommitment`, and the buyer finalizes with `relayPrivateBuy` (which verifies the TEE signature). Only the commitment lives on-chain until settlement.

### TEE signature verification

Both `relayPrivateBuy` and `settle` verify the TEE result the same way: reconstruct the hash the node signed and recover the signer, requiring it equal `teeAddress`.

```solidity
bytes32 resultHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    keccak256(_resultData), _actionId, keccak256(bytes(_submissionTag)), _status));
// Domain-separated payload — must match go-flare-common signing.TEEActionResult
bytes32 payloadHash = keccak256(abi.encode(bytes32("TEE_ACTION_RESULT"), block.chainid, resultHash));
address signer = _recover(_ethSigned(payloadHash), _signature); // EIP-191 personal-sign
require(signer == teeAddress, "bad TEE signature");
```

The node signs `keccak256(abi.encode(TEE_ACTION_RESULT_PREFIX, chainId, ActionResult.Hash()))` — not `ActionResult.Hash()` alone — with the EIP-191 prefix; only successful (`status == 1`) results are accepted. Verifying against the raw `resultHash` fails against current TEE node signatures. `SettlementTime` (a library) computes `settlementUnlockAt` = midnight UTC the day after coverage.

### Deploy notes (differ from the scaffold/fce-sign)

- Activate with `./scripts/use-chain.sh local coston2` (no language arg — the app is Go).
- Set `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` and `PAY_TOKEN` in `.env.local.coston2`. A mock ERC-20 exists on Coston2 at `0x53192e788991AD96bC180249B15AefB94E597dD1`, or deploy your own.
- Deploy with `./scripts/pre-build.sh` **then `./scripts/extension-setup.sh`** (the latter calls `setPayToken` on the deployed contract). The rest (ngrok on `6674`, `post-build.sh`, attestation, code-hash whitelisting) matches the scaffold lifecycle below.

## Attestation and Reproducible Builds

The TEE's trust comes from **remote attestation**: the Confidential Space VM measures the running image and reports a **code hash**. Flare's data providers (FTDC) only accept results from a TEE whose code hash has been **whitelisted on-chain** for that extension. This makes builds security-critical:

- **`MODE=0`** is the production attestation backend; **`MODE=1`** produces *simulated* attestation that FTDC rejects. For testnet/mainnet the image must bake `MODE=0` and `.env` must set `LOCAL_MODE=false` / `SIMULATED_TEE=false`.
- **Reproducibility:** set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (e.g. the last commit time) so the same source yields the same code hash. The **Go** path is bit-for-bit reproducible across machines (single static binary). **Python/TypeScript** reach same-machine determinism but cross-machine bit-for-bit is best-effort (pip wheels / `node_modules` embed host paths) — a rebuild on a different machine may change the code hash and force re-registration. `fce-sign` picks the language via `LANGUAGE=go|python|typescript` in `.env`.

## Deployment Lifecycle (Coston / Coston2)

The scaffold scripts chain four phases (`./scripts/full-setup.sh --chain coston2 --test` runs all of them in one shot; each can also run individually):

1. **pre-build** (`pre-build.sh`) — compile + deploy the `InstructionSender`, register the extension on `TeeExtensionRegistry`, write `EXTENSION_ID` + `INSTRUCTION_SENDER` to `config/extension.env`. Re-running reuses an existing `config/extension.env` rather than refusing to run; pass `--force` only when you intentionally want a new extension.
2. **start services** (`docker compose up -d --build`) — run `redis`, the `ext-proxy`, and the `extension-tee` (your code) as containers. Locally `LOCAL_MODE=true` skips attestation.
3. **post-build** (`post-build.sh`) — `allow-tee-version` whitelists the code hash, `set-governance` registers the extension's TEE governance signer set/threshold (defaults to the deployer with threshold 1 unless `GOVERNANCE_SIGNERS`/`GOVERNANCE_THRESHOLD` are set), then `register-tee` registers the TEE machine on-chain. Use `register-tee -command rRap` so re-runs issue a fresh attestation challenge (capital `R`) and avoid `Verification.ChallengeExpired`.
4. **test** (`test.sh`) — send instructions through the deployed TEE and verify the round-trip.

**Real testnet** adds: a funded deployer key (Coston2 faucet), a publicly reachable proxy URL (any HTTPS tunnel to port `6674` — e.g. ngrok or cloudflared), indexer-DB credentials for the proxy, and a GCP Confidential Space VM to run the image. Verify the deploy by curling the proxy `/info` and confirming `machineData`: `platform` starts with `0x4743505f414d445f534556…` (GCP_AMD_SEV), `codeHash` is a real measured hash (not the simulated `0x194844cf…`), and `extensionId`/`initialOwner` match `config/extension.env`. If the `FlareTeeManager` diamond is redeployed, all registrations are wiped — re-run pre-build for a fresh `EXTENSION_ID`, have the VM operator restart with the new ID, then re-run post-build and test.

### Common failure modes

- **`Verification.TeeNotFound`** — `NORMAL_PROXY_URL` points at the wrong chain's FTDC proxy.
- **`Verification.ChallengeExpired`** — re-run post-build; ensure `register-tee` uses `-command rRap`.
- **`InvalidGovernanceHash`** — `GOVERNANCE_SIGNERS`/`GOVERNANCE_THRESHOLD` don't match the governance hash the TEE node signed; leave unset for deployer-only defaults, or align both sides and re-run post-build.
- **`code hashes do not match`** — `SIMULATED_TEE` and the image's `MODE` disagree; both must be "real" (`SIMULATED_TEE=false`, `MODE=0`).
- **`connect: connection refused` from ext-proxy** — VPN/route to Flare's indexer DB is down.

## When to Use a Different Skill

- Reading **FTSO** price feeds, **FDC** attestations, **FAssets** minting/redemption, or **Smart Accounts** — use those dedicated skills.
- General network facts (chain IDs, RPCs, faucets, explorers) — use `flare-general`.

Use **this** skill when the task involves confidential/TEE execution: building or deploying an extension, the InstructionSender/registry pattern, attestation and code-hash whitelisting, the types server, parametric insurance on TEE, or the `fce-extension-scaffold` / `fce-sign` / `fce-weather-insurance` repos.
