# FAssets Direct Minting Guide

Direct minting enables users to create FAssets (currently FXRP) through a **single transaction on the underlying blockchain**, bypassing the standard multi-step collateral reservation process. Payments go to the **Core Vault address** rather than individual agents.

## How It Differs from Standard Minting

| | Standard Minting | Direct Minting |
|---|---|---|
| Steps | 4 (reserve → pay → proof → execute) | 1 (send payment) |
| Destination | Individual agent address | Core Vault address |
| Collateral reservation | Required (pays CRF) | Not required |
| Parameter encoding | Payment reference from event | Destination tag or memo field |
| Executor | Optional | Required (with fallback) |

## Core Mechanism

1. Minter sends a payment on XRPL to the **Core Vault address** (obtained via `directMintingPaymentAddress()` on AssetManager).
2. Minting parameters (recipient, preferred executor) are encoded in the **destination tag** or **memo field**.
3. An executor calls `executeDirectMinting` on Flare to finalize; the executor receives a fee.

## Finalizing on Flare — Two Entry Points

After the XRPL payment confirms, an executor finalizes the mint by calling one of two `AssetManager` entry points with an FDC `XRPPayment` proof. No prior collateral reservation is required.

| Entry point | Use for |
|-------------|---------|
| `executeDirectMinting(IXRPPayment.Proof _payment)` | Plain direct mints to an EOA/contract (32-byte or 48-byte memo, or destination tag); and smart-account flows where the full `PackedUserOperation` is carried **inline** in the XRPL memo (`0xFF` memo-field custom instruction). |
| `executeDirectMintingWithData(IXRPPayment.Proof _payment, bytes _data)` | Smart-account flows where the XRPL memo commits to a user operation **by hash only** (`0xFE` custom instruction). The executor supplies the ABI-encoded `PackedUserOperation` in `_data` alongside the proof. |

Both are `payable`. On success the executor receives the executor fee and the contract emits `DirectMintingExecuted`.

**Smart-account atomicity:** When the recipient is a [Flare Smart Account](../flare-smart-accounts-skill/SKILL.md) personal account and the XRPL memo carries a custom instruction (`0xFE` or `0xFF`), the mint and the user operation are dispatched **atomically** — `executeDirectMintingWithData` mints FXRP and runs the user op in one transaction. If that call reverts, **no FXRP is minted** and the underlying XRP remains at the Core Vault until recovered (it is not auto-refunded to XRPL). See the smart-accounts skill's recovery flow (`0xE0` skip-memo) for how a stuck payment is finalized.

## Fee Structure

Two fees are deducted from the underlying payment amount:

| Fee | Type | Recipient |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **Minting Fee** | Percentage-based (BIPS) with minimum floor | Governance-configured receiver |
| **Executor Fee** | Flat amount in underlying asset | Executor |

**Priority:** Minting fee takes priority. If the payment is below the minimum minting fee floor, no FAssets are minted. If funds are insufficient for both fees, the executor fee is reduced before the minting fee.

**Query fee parameters:**
```
AssetManager.getDirectMintingMinimumFeeUBA()   // minimum minting fee (floor)
AssetManager.getDirectMintingFeeBIPS()          // minting fee percentage
AssetManager.getDirectMintingExecutorFeeUBA()   // flat executor fee
AssetManager.getDirectMintingFeeReceiver()      // address receiving minting fees
```

## Parameter Encoding Methods

### Method 1: Destination Tag (Recommended for Recurring Use)

- Uses the 32-bit integer destination tag native to XRPL transactions.
- The `MintingTagManager` contract maps tag IDs to Flare-side parameters (recipient address, preferred executor).
- Best for recurring minting operations where the recipient and executor are fixed.

**Workflow:**
1. Reserve a minting tag via `IMintingTagManager.reserve()` (pays a reservation fee in FLR/SGB).
2. Optionally set a custom minting recipient: `IMintingTagManager.setMintingRecipient(tagId, recipientAddress)`.
3. Optionally set a preferred executor: call `setAllowedExecutor` (10-minute cooldown before new executor activates).
4. Send XRPL payment to the Core Vault address with the tag ID as the destination tag.

**Get the MintingTagManager address:**
```
AssetManager.getMintingTagManager()
```

**Developer guide (TypeScript/viem):** [Direct Mint FXRP with Tag](https://dev.flare.network/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint-tag) — end-to-end example from `flare-viem-starter`: reserve tag, bind recipient, send XRP payment with the destination tag, wait for `DirectMintingExecuted`. Dependencies: `xrpl`, `viem`, `@flarenetwork/flare-wagmi-periphery-package`.

**Skill script (ethers + xrpl):** [scripts/direct-mint-fxrp-tag.ts](scripts/direct-mint-fxrp-tag.ts) — reserves a tag (or reuses one via `EXISTING_TAG_ID`), binds recipient, then submits the XRPL Payment with `DestinationTag`. Dry-run by default.

### Method 2: Memo Field

Two binary formats are supported in the XRPL transaction memo field:

**32-byte format (recipient only — anyone can execute):**
```
[8 bytes prefix: 0x4642505266410018] [4 bytes zero padding: 0x00000000] [20 bytes recipient address]
```
- Prefix `0x4642505266410018` signals `DIRECT_MINTING`.
- The 4-byte zero-padding segment is required in this format.
- Anyone can call `executeDirectMinting` after `othersCanExecuteAfterSeconds`.

**48-byte format (recipient + executor):**
```
[8 bytes prefix: 0x4642505266410021] [20 bytes recipient address] [20 bytes executor address]
```
- Prefix `0x4642505266410021` signals `DIRECT_MINTING_EX`.
- Set executor address to `address(0)` (zero address) to allow anyone to execute.

**Developer guide (TypeScript/viem):** [Direct Mint FXRP](https://dev.flare.network/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint) — end-to-end example from `flare-viem-starter`: build the 32-byte memo (prefix `0x4642505266410018` + 4 zero bytes + recipient address, lowercased without `0x`), send XRPL payment to the Core Vault, wait for `DirectMintingExecuted`. Dependencies: `xrpl`, `viem`, `@flarenetwork/flare-wagmi-periphery-package`. Helpers: `getDirectMintingPaymentAddress()`, `computeDirectMintingPaymentAmountXrp()` (covers minting + executor fees), `waitForDirectMintingOutcome()` (logs `executionAllowedAt` if `DirectMintingDelayed` fires first, then keeps polling until `DirectMintingExecuted` — do not treat the delay as a failure or resend the XRPL payment).

**Skill script (ethers + xrpl):** [scripts/direct-mint-fxrp.ts](scripts/direct-mint-fxrp.ts) — reads Core Vault address and fee parameters, builds the 32-byte memo, and submits the XRPL Payment. Dry-run by default.

## Executor Restrictions

Enforcement depends on which encoding method is used:

| Method | Executor Enforcement |
|--------|---------------------|
| Tag-based | Governed by `setAllowedExecutor` on MintingTagManager |
| Memo-based | Encoded directly in memo (zero address = anyone) |
| Smart account | AssetManager enforces restrictions |

**Fallback:** If the preferred executor does not act, anyone can execute after `othersCanExecuteAfterSeconds` elapses.

```
AssetManager.getDirectMintingOthersCanExecuteAfterSeconds()
```

## Rate Limiting Parameters

Direct minting is subject to rate limits that delay (not reject) large or high-frequency mints:

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `getDirectMintingHourlyLimitUBA()` | Hourly cap on total minted |
| `getDirectMintingDailyLimitUBA()` | Daily cap on total minted |
| `getDirectMintingLargeMintingThresholdUBA()` | Threshold above which a mint is "large" |
| `getDirectMintingLargeMintingDelaySeconds()` | Fixed delay added to large mints |

**Throttling behavior:**
- Limits delay the execution rather than rejecting it.
- A mint is "large" when its amount is **strictly greater than** `getDirectMintingLargeMintingThresholdUBA()`; it then incurs the fixed `getDirectMintingLargeMintingDelaySeconds()` delay independently of the hourly/daily windows — this still applies even when both windows have full headroom. Large mints are not counted toward the hourly/daily windows.
- Hourly/daily throttling emits `DirectMintingDelayed`; the large-mint delay emits a separate `LargeDirectMintingDelayed` event instead (both carry an `executionAllowedAt` timestamp). A bound mint does not revert — it re-executes via the same finalizing call (`executeDirectMinting`/`executeDirectMintingWithData`) with the same FDC proof once `executionAllowedAt` passes.
- If multiple rules apply, `executionAllowedAt` is whichever pushes furthest into the future.
- Governance can unblock the **hourly/daily** limiter via `unblockDirectMintingsUntil` after manual review (emits `DirectMintingsUnblocked`) — this bypass does **not** apply to the large-minting delay; amounts above the threshold are still held for `getDirectMintingLargeMintingDelaySeconds()`. After unblocking, call `markUnblockedDirectMintingAllowed(transactionId)` to reset a preferred executor's exclusive window from the unblock time.
- Query `directMintingDelayState(transactionId)` → `allowedAt` to read the current delay/unblock state for a given XRPL transaction.

**Pre-flight check:** [Check Direct Minting Limits](https://dev.flare.network/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint-limits) — reads and replays the tumbling-window state off-chain, then evaluates a proposed amount against all three delay mechanisms (hourly, daily, large-mint) to report whether it would execute immediately or emit `DirectMintingDelayed`/`LargeDirectMintingDelayed`. `bigintMin(hourlyHeadroom, dailyHeadroom, largeThresholdUBA)` is the largest amount that avoids delay from any rule (minting exactly at the large-mint threshold is fine; strictly above it triggers the hold).

**Other events on `executeDirectMinting`:**
- `DirectMintingExecutedToSmartAccount` — fires instead of `DirectMintingExecuted` when the payment has no registered tag recipient and no valid direct-minting memo; FAssets mint to the smart account manager, which routes them by `sourceAddress`/`memoData`. The executor fee is not set by AssetManager in this path.
- `DirectMintingPaymentTooSmallForFee` — fires (without reverting) when `receivedAmount < getDirectMintingMinimumFeeUBA()`; the entire payment goes to the fee receiver and neither the minter nor executor receives anything.

## MintingTagManager — Key Facts

- Tags are NFTs (ERC-721-like); ownership can be transferred.
- Tag IDs are assigned sequentially (limited 32-bit space prevents squatting; reservation requires FLR/SGB payment).
- On transfer, minting recipient resets to the new owner and allowed executor is cleared.
- `setAllowedExecutor` has a **10-minute cooldown** before the new executor becomes active.

**Testnet Coston2 parameters:**
- Reservation fee: 100 C2FLR
- Reserved tag count: 20
- NFT collection name: "Minting Tag Manager (FTestXRP open beta)"

## IMintingTagManager API

Access via `AssetManager.getMintingTagManager()`.

### Functions

**`reserve()` → uint256**
Payable. Reserves a new minting tag NFT by paying the reservation fee. Returns the newly reserved tag ID. Caller becomes the tag owner and initial minting recipient.

**`setMintingRecipient(uint256 _mintingTag, address _recipient)`**
Sets the minting recipient address for a tag. Only callable by the tag owner. Recipient receives minted FAssets when the tag is used.

**`reservationFee()` → uint256**
View. Returns the native currency fee required to reserve a tag.

**`reservedTagsForOwner(address _owner)` → uint256[]**
View. Returns all minting tag IDs owned by an address.

**`transfer(address _to, uint256 _mintingTag)`**
Transfers a minting tag to a new owner. Resets minting recipient to the new owner and clears the allowed executor.

**`mintingRecipient(uint256 _mintingTag)` → address**
View. Returns the current minting recipient for a tag.

**`allowedExecutor(uint256 _mintingTag)` → address**
View. Returns the active allowed executor for a tag (`address(0)` if unset).

**`setAllowedExecutor(uint256 _mintingTag, address _executor)`**
Tag owner only. Designates `_executor` as the sole address permitted to execute direct mintings with this tag (must not be `address(0)`). Subject to a 10-minute cooldown before the new executor becomes active. If never set, any address may execute. Cleared on `transfer`.

## Security Considerations

- Always verify the Core Vault address via `AssetManager.directMintingPaymentAddress()` — do not hardcode.
- Memo field binary data is untrusted external input; decode strictly per the fixed binary formats documented above.
- Delayed mints (from rate limiting) will still execute once the `executionAllowedAt` timestamp passes — monitor the `DirectMintingDelayed`/`LargeDirectMintingDelayed` events.
- Tag ownership transfers reset executor permissions; verify executor is still valid after any transfer.
